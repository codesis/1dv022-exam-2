        <p id="information">Let's play! <br>In this quiz you'll have a maximum of 20 seconds to answer
            each question. If you answer wrong <i>or</i> not in time, the game is over
            and you'll find yourself at the highscore page. And hey, it's not just about
            having maximum correct answers to be on the top of the highscore - the whole
            quiz is on time as well!

            - Good luck!
